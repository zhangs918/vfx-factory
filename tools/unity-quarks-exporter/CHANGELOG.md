# Changelog

All notable changes to the Unity Quarks Exporter are documented here.

## [0.19.0] — 2026-07-25

### Added

- Mesh particle geometry now exports **normals** (recalculated when missing) so mesh shading and
  environment reflections work after load.
- When the particle material has a **Cubemap** (`_Cube` / `_Cubemap` / …), it is baked into an
  embedded 3×2 `reflectionAtlas` plus `reflectionLevel` for babylon.quarks mesh env sampling.

### Changed

- The exporter now carries the same version as the babylon.quarks packages it
  writes for, which is why this release jumps from 0.2.0 to 0.19.0. Nothing was
  released in between; the two are versioned together from here on, so the
  exporter version tells you which library version its output was written
  against.

### Fixed

- Constant `rate × life` that lands on a whole number gets one simulation step
  of lifetime slack on export. Quarks' fixed 1/60 clock otherwise leaves one
  blank frame per period on that knife edge (BlackHole's beam/ring); Unity's
  own tip is "life 1.01". Curves and random ranges are left alone.
- Gravity is exported as a world-space force. It was written as an `ApplyForce`,
  whose direction is added straight to the velocity and so gets turned by the
  emitter's own rotation: a particle system carrying Unity's usual -90° about X
  had its gravity pushing sideways instead of down. Now exported as
  `ForceOverLife`, which undoes the emitter transform.
- Textures Unity keeps in its built-in bundle (`Default-Particle` and friends)
  are embedded properly. They report a virtual asset path with no file behind
  it, so the exporter used to write that path into the image url and the effect
  loaded with a broken texture. Non-readable, compressed and authoring-format
  textures (`.tga`, `.psd`, …) had the same problem — the latter were embedded
  byte-for-byte but labelled `image/png`. All of them are now re-encoded to PNG
  through a render texture. An effect that still cannot embed a texture now logs
  a warning naming it.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Tools → Quarks → Export Folder of Effects to JSON** — batch-export every prefab with a
  `ParticleSystem` under a selected Assets folder; output directory mirrors the source
  subfolder layout.
- Progress bar with cancel support during batch export.
- Public `ExportToFile(GameObject, string)` and `ExportFolder(string assetFolder, string outputFolder)`
  APIs for scripting and CI.

### Changed

- Single-effect export refactored to use `ExportToFile`; behaviour unchanged.

## [0.1.0] — initial release

- Export selected hierarchy to babylon.quarks JSON (Shuriken modules → quarks behaviours).
