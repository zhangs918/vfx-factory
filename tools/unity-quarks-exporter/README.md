# Unity → Quarks Exporter

A Unity Editor utility that exports a Shuriken **Particle System** effect to the
**babylon.quarks** JSON format — the same envelope that [`QuarksLoader`](../../packages/babylon.quarks/src/QuarksLoader.ts)
loads and that the [effect editor](../../packages/babylon.quarks-editor) reads. Author an effect in
Unity, export it, and drop it straight into a Babylon.js scene.

## Install

Pick one:

- **`.unitypackage`** — download `BabylonQuarksUnityExporter.unitypackage` from the
  [latest release](https://github.com/Soullnik/babylon.quarks-standalone/releases/latest), then
  in Unity: **Assets → Import Package → Custom Package…**. Lands under
  `Assets/BabylonQuarksUnityExporter/Editor/`. Built from this folder by
  `npm run build:unitypackage` (wired into the release pipeline, see
  [`build-unitypackage.mjs`](../../scripts/build-unitypackage.mjs)).
- **Copy into a project** — copy the `Editor/` folder anywhere under your project's `Assets/`
  (e.g. `Assets/QuarksExporter/Editor/`). The scripts are editor-only (guarded by the assembly
  definition), so they never ship in a build.
- **As a local UPM package** — in `Packages/manifest.json` add:
    ```json
    "com.babylonquarks.unity-exporter": "file:../path/to/tools/unity-quarks-exporter"
    ```

Requires Unity **2020.3+**.

## Use

### Single effect

1. In the Hierarchy, select the GameObject of your effect. This can be a single Particle System
   or a **parent** GameObject containing several (sub-emitters and grouped systems included).
2. Menu **Tools → Quarks → Export Selected Effect to JSON**.
3. Choose where to save the `.json`. Textures are embedded as data URIs, so the file is
   self-contained.

### Folder of prefabs

1. In the **Project** window, select a folder under `Assets` that contains effect prefabs
   (each prefab root or children must include at least one `ParticleSystem`).
2. Menu **Tools → Quarks → Export Folder of Effects to JSON**.
3. Pick an output folder on disk. Every matching prefab is exported as `{name}.json`; subfolders
   under the selected Assets folder are mirrored in the output.

Load the result in Babylon.js:

```ts
import {QuarksLoader} from 'babylon.quarks';

const loader = new QuarksLoader(scene, {baseUrl: ''});
const root = loader.parse(await (await fetch('Explosion.json')).json());
root.parent = batchedRenderer; // your BatchedRenderer
```

…or open it in the effect editor via **Open from JSON**.

See [`sample-output.json`](./sample-output.json) for a representative export (an emitter with a
death-triggered spark sub-emitter).

Curves convert per-segment with a Hermite→Bézier transform so tangents are preserved; Unity
gradients sample both color and alpha keys.

## Caveats (v1)

- **Coordinate space:** node transforms are exported as a straightforward local TRS matrix. Unity
  is left-handed and three.js/Babylon right-handed, so off-origin child offsets may need a manual
  tweak; effects authored at the origin are unaffected.
- **Mesh shape:** exported as a `mesh_surface` emitter plus a `Mesh` source node holding the
  geometry. That node is a real (visible) mesh in the loaded scene — hide/disable it if you only
  want it as an emission source. Box / Edge shapes still fall back to a point emitter.
- **Collision:** only `bounce` is exported. quarks resolves collisions against a host-provided
  collider (e.g. the editor's ground plane), so Unity's collision planes/world aren't carried over.
- **3D rotation:** 3D _start_ rotation is exported as an Euler generator for **Mesh** render mode
  (billboards can't tilt, so they use the Z angle only). Rotation **over lifetime** still exports
  the Z axis only.
- **Texture Sheet Animation:** the frame animation is exported as a full linear sweep over the
  sheet; Unity's `frameOverTime` curve / cycle semantics aren't mapped 1:1.
- **Blend mode** is inferred from the material's shader name / `_SrcBlend`/`_DstBlend`.
  Alpha Blended / Premultiply map to alpha blend; Additive → additive; Multiply/Modulate →
  multiply. Unusual custom shaders default to alpha blend.
- **Mesh env map:** if the particle material exposes a Cubemap (`_Cube`, `_Cubemap`,
  `_ReflectionCubemap`, …, or any Cubemap-typed texture property), it is baked into a 3×2
  `reflectionAtlas` (px py pz / nx ny nz) so babylon.quarks can sample reflections on iOS.
  Materials without a cubemap export lit/diffuse only. Skybox is not used as a fallback.
- Modules with no quarks counterpart (Lights, Trails ribbon, Custom Data, Collision triggers) are
  skipped.

  Json.cs                 minimal JSON writer (no dependencies)
  ValueConverter.cs       MinMaxCurve / Gradient / AnimationCurve → quarks value JSON
  ExportContext.cs        meta accumulation, texture embedding, node-uuid maps
  ParticleConverter.cs    Shuriken modules → the per-system "ps" object
